// Agent Deathmatch — authoritative game server, in-process with the Next app.
//
// Served at `/ws/instagib` on the main app port so it rides the existing
// Cloudflare tunnel (wss://<domain>/ws/instagib) — no separate port/process.
//
// ROOMS: every match is a Room. A socket is either a "lister" (browsing the
// lobby) or "in" exactly one room. Quick-match drops you into an open public
// room (or makes one); Create-Match makes a public ("Custom Lobby") or private
// (invite-only) room. Reaching the frag limit starts an end-of-match MAP VOTE,
// then the room resets onto the winning map.
//
// Trust model: the SERVER decides hits. The shooter sends a shot RAY plus the
// server-clock render time it was displaying others at; the server rewinds
// every other player IN THE SAME ROOM to that time (lag compensation) using a
// position history buffer and raycasts their hitboxes. Shared arena geometry
// caps every shot at the nearest wall; the client may shorten that cap.
// Spawns / out-of-bounds use the THREE-free `arena-data` table.

// since 64Hz sends keep a sample within 16ms). The SAME resampled pos feeds both
// the snapshot AND the lag-comp history, so what a viewer sees is exactly what
// the server rewinds to → smoother motion AND fewer "hit but no kill".
// The resample lag is PER PLAYER and adaptive: a clean ~40ms sender gets the
// floor; a player whose position arrives in bursts (TCP stalls on their upstream
// — what makes a high-ping player stutter for everyone) gets buffered more, so

// client steps its sim inside requestAnimationFrame, so on a 60Hz display every
// ~16th frame runs two ticks and flushes two uploads together, on 144Hz the
// gaps alternate ~14/21ms, and any hitch flushes 2–5 at once. Stamped by
// arrival, each flush reads as "no time passed, then a jump" and every viewer
// sees that player micro-stutter, even at 20ms ping. Stamped by tick, samples
// are exactly 15.625ms apart on the sender's own timeline, whatever the frame
// pacing or the network did.
//
// The snapshot tick then plays each sender's timeline back at
//   simTime = now − playoutMs
// where playoutMs covers the 95th percentile of their recent arrival lateness
// (arrival − sim time, over a ~2.5s window) + one tick, so the sample after the
// playout point has almost always arrived (interpolation). The rare late ones —
// a GC pause or long frame on the sender, flushed as a burst — are bridged by a
// short capped extrapolation instead of raising everyone's view of that player
// by the hitch (a rolling MAX doubled the delay for a routine 45ms hitch).
// Clients send one unchanged sample before going quiet, so a stop is always
// visible as zero velocity and extrapolation never runs past it. playoutMs
// slews toward its target at a bounded rate — asymmetric: rises quickly for a
// sender that turns bursty, relaxes slowly — and snaps only on a large
