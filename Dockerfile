# Agent Deathmatch — multi-stage image.
#
# Build stage: install everything (incl. dev deps) and produce the client
# bundle in dist/. Runtime stage: a lean image with only production deps
# (tsx remains because the server runs `node --import tsx server/index.ts`),
# the built client, the server, and the THREE-free shared game modules.
